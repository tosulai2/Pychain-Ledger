# Pychain-Ledger

UC Fintech Bootcamp Challenge 18 Module 18 Challenge assignment for the UC Berkeley Fintech Bootcamp.

In this challenge, I built a blockchain-based ledger system, complete with a user-friendly web interface. This ledger should allow partner banks to conduct financial transactions and to verify the integrity of the data in the ledger.

I created a Jupyter notebook that contains code for data collection from CSV data, preparation of datasets for analysis by cleaningmissing/erroneous data, and analysis through summary and visualizations toselect time periods for arbitrage opportunities.

## Technologies

This project uses Python programming language, dataclasses for the block records and a streamlit library and functions associated to display online, etc.

## Installation Guide

Make sure to install streamlit library

## Usage

This is what the streamlit app looks like after entering a few blocks

This is the full ledger of block transactions in the streamlit app

This is what it looks like on the streamlit app when you verify the blockchain
