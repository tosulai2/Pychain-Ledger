# Pychain-Ledger

UC Fintech Bootcamp Challenge 18 Module 18 Challenge assignment for the UC Berkeley Fintech Bootcamp.

In this challenge, I built a blockchain-based ledger system, complete with a user-friendly web interface. This ledger should allow partner banks to conduct financial transactions and to verify the integrity of the data in the ledger.

I created a Jupyter notebook that contains code for data collection from CSV data, preparation of datasets for analysis by cleaningmissing/erroneous data, and analysis through summary and visualizations toselect time periods for arbitrage opportunities.

## Technologies

This project uses Python programming language, dataclasses for the block records and a streamlit library and functions associated to display online, etc.

## Installation Guide

Make sure to install streamlit library

## Usage

This is what the streamlit app looks like after entering a few blocks

This is the full ledger of block transactions in the streamlit app

This is what it looks like on the streamlit app when you verify the blockchain

This is what the command lin elooks like after entering some transactions and verifying the blockchain

Libraries used: streamlit, dataclasses, typing, Any, List, datetime, pandas and hashlib
